                        <span class="thoughts">Gets a little lost in the details, but a great history lesson on the pro/amatuer divide unknown by many modern golfers. </span>
                    </li>
                    <li>The Martian <br/>
                        <span class="thoughts">Written by a nerd for nerds. Now I want to see the movie. </span>
                    </li>
                    <li>Bleach <br/>
                        <span class="thoughts">Well it's finally over. Been reading since highschool, and I can't help but wonder if it was cancelled - based on how rushed the ending was. </span>
                    </li>
                    <li>Odd Thomas <br/>
                        <span class="thoughts">A little fluffy, but a real page turner. </span>
                    </li>
                    <li>A New Kind of Christian <br/>
                        <span class="thoughts">I'm a fan of McClaren's prose as well as his practical theology. He argues for a Christianity and the church evolve to embrace and minster to an increasingly postmodern world.</span>
                    </li>  
                    <li>Dune <br/> 
                        <span class="thoughts">In spite of how long ago the story was written, I knew little about it. Herbert's universe fascinated me more than any other in recent memory. Unfortunately it shows its age with some sexism and homophobia.</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>Naoki Urasawa's Monster <br/> 
                        <span class="thoughts">Thrilling. My favorite manga to date.</span>

                    <li>The Ocean at the End of the Lane <br/> 
                        <span class="thoughts">Familiar with his comics, I wanted to read a Gaiman novel. I was not disappointed.</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>The Dark Tower Series <br/> 
                        <span class="thoughts">Read over the span of 4 years. Compelling throughout, but the shines most in the end.</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>Treasure Island <br/> 
                        <span class="thoughts">Recieved a nifty leather version as a gift. Great to revisit a story from childhood.</span>

                    <li>The Life of Pi <br/> 
                        <span class="thoughts">Read after I saw the film. Beautiful.</span>

                        <span class="thoughts">Great game that provided me tons of entertainment, but with school I didn't have the time to play enough to enjoy it.</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>Final Fantasy Brave Exvius<br/>
                        <span class="thoughts">Well made and I was briefly sucked in pretty deep, but I'm making an effort to not let things this shallow absorb so much of my time. So I deleted it. </span>
                    </li>
                    <li>Monument Valley<br/>
                        <span class="thoughts">Zen.</span>

                    <li>Human Resource Machine <br/> 
                        <span class="thoughts">This game had me programming a Fibonacci sequence in assembly - for fun. Full of character, but not sure if a non-programmer would have as much fun as I did.</span>

                    <li>Chrono Trigger <br/> 
                        <span class="thoughts">Completely deserving of the praise it so often receives.</span>

                    <li>Donkey Kong 64 <br/> 
                        <span class="thoughts">Ugh. As fun as I remember in parts, but plagued by some glaring design issues. See my blog <a href="/2016/06/07/dk64.html">rant.</a></span>
                    </li>
                    <li>Machinarium <br/>

                    </li>
                    <li>Divinity Original Sin <br/> 
                        <span class="thoughts">Co-op done right. True to its tabletop roots without letting them bog gameplay down. Story wasn't particularly memorable, but the gameplay made up for it.</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>Terraria <br/> 
                        <span class="thoughts">Played as couch co-op on PS4. Really a blast, but the experience would have been better on PC.</span>

                        <span class="thoughts">Intruiging, low-budget flick about time travel. The character reactions are wonderfully realistic.</span>
