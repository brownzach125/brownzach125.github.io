Hobby game I developed for fun. The game centers around two wizards flinging 
'spells' written in javascript at each other. Before matches its up to the players to write spells 
using arbitrary javascript and the basic spells to come up with the best arsenal for defeating their opponent.
Under the hood the basic spells work like system calls in an operating system. They can actually change the game state like creating a fireball, 
but will only do so if the player is actually allowed to do so at that time.
