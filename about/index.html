    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <!-- TODO I should specify what kind of team I work on in NI and I should play up more of my interests -->
    <p>
    I am a Software Engineer residing in Austin, TX. I graduated from <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/cse/" target="_blank">Texas A&amp;M University</a>
        and work as a Software Engineer at <a href="http://www.ni.com/en-us.html" target="_blank">National Instruments</a>.
    I've written front-ends using Javascript, HTML5 and CSS and I've also written the server code to go with in either Python or Nodejs.
    At National Instruments I work on Linux Device drivers and make <a href="https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/9402205/" target="_blank">improvements</a> to the Linux Kernel.
    I also create tools to analyze and visualize data and improve development efficiency..
    In my current role, I often interface with subject-matter experts to help solve challenging problems and learn from their experience.
    I'm driven by the desire to learn new things and solve problems outside my comfortable area of expertise.
    I'm open to new opportunities and to relocating.

    In my free time I enjoy to playing games, rock climbing, reading science fiction novels and creating a <a href="https://github.com/brownzach125/PJBot" target="_blank">StarCraft BroodWar AI</a>.
